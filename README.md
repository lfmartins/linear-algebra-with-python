# linear-algebra-with-python

A collection of Jupyter notebooks for learning linear algebra.

The goal of these notebooks is not to show how to solve linear algebra problems efficiently, but to provide a learning environment to explore concepts and techniques.

The notebooks were created using Jupyter Lab, using the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) distribution.
